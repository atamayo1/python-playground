# 🐍 Python Study Playground

This repository documents my Python study process in preparation for entering a Master's program.

It serves as a structured learning notebook where I explore Python fundamentals, problem solving, and computational thinking using Jupyter notebooks.

## 🎓 Purpose

The goal of this repository is academic preparation:

- Strengthen Python foundations
- Develop logical and algorithmic thinking
- Practice problem solving
- Build consistency before graduate studies
- Document learning progress over time

This is a living study journal, not a production project.

## 📚 Format

Most content is written in **Jupyter notebooks**, combining:

- Code experiments
- Exercises
- Explanations
- Notes
- Iterative learning

Each notebook reflects a focused study session or topic.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Python syntax & fundamentals
- Lists, dictionaries, and data structures
- String manipulation
- Control flow
- Functions
- Basic algorithms
- Logic exercises
- Data handling

More advanced topics will be added as the study progresses.

## 🚀 How to use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/atamayo1/python-playground.git


Open notebooks:

jupyter notebook

or

jupyter lab


## 📌 Notes

This repository intentionally captures the raw learning process — including mistakes, iterations, and exploration — as part of academic growth.
